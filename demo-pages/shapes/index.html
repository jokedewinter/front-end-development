				<p>A demonstration is action by a mass group or collection of groups of people in favour of a political or other cause. It often consists of walking in a mass march formation and either beginning with or meeting at a designated endpoint, or rally, to hear speakers.</p>

				<h3>Types of demonstration</h3>
				<p>Demonstrations are sometimes spontaneous gatherings, but are also utilised as a tactical choice by movements. They often form part of a larger campaign of nonviolent resistance, often also called civil resistance. Demonstrations are generally staged in public, but private demonstrations are certainly possible, especially if the demonstrators wish to influence the opinions of a small or very specific group of people. Demonstrations are usually physical gatherings, but virtual or online demonstrations are certainly possible.</p>

				<h3>Nonviolence or violence</h3>
				<p>Protest marches and demonstrations are a common nonviolent tactic. They are thus one tactic available to proponents of strategic nonviolence. However, the reasons for avoiding the use of violence may also derive, not from a general doctrine of nonviolence or pacifism, but from considerations relating to the particular situation that is faced, including its legal, cultural and power-political dimensions: this has been the case in many campaigns of civil resistance.</p>

			<article>
				<h3>Times and Locations</h3>
				<p>Sometimes the date or location chosen for the demonstration is of historical or cultural significance, such as the anniversary of some event that is relevant to the topic of the demonstration. Locations are also chosen because of some relevance to the issue at hand.</p>
